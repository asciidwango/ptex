% original texmf.cnf -- runtime path configuration file for kpathsea.
% 
% (If you change or delete `original' on the previous line, the
% distribution won't install its version over yours.)
% 
% What follows is a super-summary of what this .cnf file can
% contain. Please read the Kpathsea manual for more information.
% 
% texmf.cnf is generated from texmf.cnf.in, by replacing @var@ with the
% value of the Make variable `var', via a sed file texmf.sed, generated
% (once) by kpathsea/Makefile (itself generated from
% kpathsea/Makefile.in by configure).
% 
% Any identifier (sticking to A-Za-z_ for names is safest) can be assigned.
% The `=' (and surrounding spaces) is optional.
% No space, %, or @ in variable values, for the sake of autogeneration.
% An environment variable foo overrides a definition of foo here.
% $foo (or ${foo}) in a value expands to the envvar or cnf value of foo.
% 
% All definitions are read before anything is expanded, so you can use
% variables before they are defined.
% 
% If a variable is qualified with `.<program>', it is ignored unless the
% current executable (last component of argv[0]) is named <program>.
% 
% Which file formats use which paths for searches is described in the
% various programs' and the kpathsea documentation.
% 
% // means to search subdirectories (recursively).
% A leading !! means to look only in the ls-R db, never on the disk.
% A leading/trailing/doubled : in the paths will be expanded into the
%   compile-time default. Probably not what you want.


% Where the wild files are. You can set an environment variable to
% override this if you're testing a new TeX tree, without changing
% anything else.
TEXMF = /usr/local/lib/texmf

% TeX input files -- i.e., anything to be found by \input or \openin,
% including .sty, .eps, etc.  Things are confused by the many variants
% of LaTeX, which all have the same filenames.  The current
% recommendation is to make `latex' be latex2e, and if you also want to
% support latex 2.09, call it latex209. If you do the reverse, the
% definitions below will need adjusting.
% 
latex209_inputs = .:$TEXMF/tex/latex209//:$TEXMF/tex//
latex2e_inputs = .:$TEXMF/tex/latex2e//:$TEXMF/tex//

% Earlier entries override later ones, so put this last.
TEXINPUTS = .:$TEXMF/tex//

% Ditto for MF.

% Predigested formats and string pools for initex/inimf.

% Just an abbreviation.
pkdir = $TEXMF/fonts//pk

% The $MAKETEX_MODE below means the drivers will not use a cx font when
% the mode is ricoh.  If no mode is explicitly specified, kpse_prog_init
% sets MAKETEX_MODE to /, so all subdirectories are searched.  See the manual.

% xdvi needs to find bitmaps for PostScript fonts, which can be
% generated by standalone programs gsftopk and ps2pk (ps2mf needs no
% special treatment). See xdvik/INSTALL for more info.
PKFONTS.xdvi = .:$pkdir/$MAKETEX_MODE:$pkdir/gsftopk:$pkdir/ps2pk
% Again, the standard definition must come after the program-specific one.
% Don't use $pkdir since we can't do general variable expansion making paths.h.
PKFONTS = .:$TEXMF/fonts//pk/$MAKETEX_MODE

% Similarly for the GF format, which only remains in existence because
% Metafont outputs it (and MF isn't going to change).
GFFONTS = .:$TEXMF/fonts//gf/$MAKETEX_MODE

% Used to find texfonts.map; also a backup for PKFONTS and GFFONTS,
% but normally that is irrelevant, so don't bother with all subdirectories.

% Enable this (or set the environment variable) if you want kpathsea to
% log names and times for all files found.

% This definition isn't used from this .cnf file itself (that would be
% paradoxical), but the compile-time default in paths.h is built from it.
